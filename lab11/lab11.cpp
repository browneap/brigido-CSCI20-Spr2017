/* 
I'm creating a series of instructions for a game between a user and a program 
The program will randomly generate a number
The number generated will be a number between two pre-selected numbers, a boundary of numbers.
The number will be generated randomly when the user commands it.
The user will guess a number
Then the user will have the program generate a random number.
If the user guesses the number correctly, the user wins.
If the user does not guess correctly, the program will tell them to chose a new number, either "higher" or "lower".
The uuser will then guess another number according to the feedback from the program.
The program will continue to tell them to guess again, telling them to go higher or lower until the user guesses correctly.
The game will keep count of incorrect guesses, deducting 1 point with every incorrect guess.
The user starts with 10 points.
